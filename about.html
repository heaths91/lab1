<h1>About</h1>

<p>Web design is very new to me, but I think I am getting the hang of it.<br>
 In my spare time I play on a wheelchair basketball team <a href='https://www.metroparkstacoma.org/adaptive-team1'>the Tacoma Titans</a>.<br>
 Along with GIS and geography, the outdoors are very important to me, but it is also this love for the outdoors that led me to living in a chair.<br>

 While mountain biking in 2015, here in the Teanaway region of eastern Washington, I crashed, leaving me with a spinal cord injury and paralyzed from the chest down. Although that may sound very grim, my life following has been full of amazing experiences. I am truly blessed and have a fantastic life, with an amazing group of people around me including my girlfriend and fantastic family. Thank you for hearing a little bit more about me!</p>
